- 👋 Hi, I’m @FcoFraguas1987
- 👀 I’m interested in bioinformatics and its intersection between DS and ML
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python (there's always something new)
- 🙂 I will learn javascript as well (hope soon better than late)
- 👨🏼‍🔬 I studied food science and technology, but I have no fear learning new things.
